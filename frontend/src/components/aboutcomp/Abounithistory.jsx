          <strong className="text-blue-600">National Institute of Technology (NIT) Patna</strong> is the 18th National Institute of Technology created by the Ministry of H.R.D., Government of India, after rechristening the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering Patna on January 28, 2004.

          NIT Patna marked its humble beginning in 1886 with the establishment of Pleaders Survey Training School, which was subsequently promoted to Bihar College of Engineering Patna in 1924. This made this institute the 6th oldest engineering institute of India. The graduate-level curriculum was later elevated to the postgraduate level in 1978.

          The institute is situated on the south bank of the holy river Ganges behind Gandhi Ghat, one of the most important and reverential places of Patna. The Gandhi Ghat is associated with the immersion of ashes of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, in the river Ganges. The campus has a picturesque river view with historic buildings, presenting a spectacle of architectural delight and natural beauty.
